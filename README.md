# DataEngineering
Python Project for Data Engineering

This is a final project in "Python Project for Data Engineering" course offerred by IBM in Coursera. The course is really a short project that involves applying what you learned in python to do the ff:

    Collect data using APIs
    Collect data using webscraping.
    Download files to process.
    Read csv, xml and json file types.
    Extract data from the above file types.
    Transform data.
    Use the built in logging module.
    Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format which data engineers can use to load the data.

This repo serves as my code for the final project where I have to apply the concepts in the previous exercises.
